						Escrow provides an added layer of security for both buyers and
						sellers in transactions, especially when trust or significant
						amounts are involved. By using escrow, funds are safeguarded by a
						neutral third party until all terms of the transaction are met,
						ensuring fair exchanges and reducing the risk of fraud. Escrow
						services like Wiremiâ€™s help make transactions smoother and more
						reliable, allowing both parties to focus on successful outcomes
						rather than security concerns
